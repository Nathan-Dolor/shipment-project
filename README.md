git clone https://github.com/Nathan-Dolor/shipment-project.git
cd shipment-project
```
### 2. Backend Setup

```bash
cd shipment-management

# Install dependencies
composer install

# Copy the environment file
cp .env.example .env

# Set up your database credentials in .env

# Generate app key
php artisan key:generate

# Run migrations
php artisan migrate

# Start the backend server
php artisan serve
```
> The API will run at http://localhost:8000.

### 3. Frontend Setup

```bash

## Design Decisions
1. Frameworks: React with Tailwind CSS for rapid UI development and Laravel for backend flexibility and simplicity.
2. Component Layout: Modular structure with components for summaries, charts, tables, and modals for easier maintenance.
3. Responsiveness: Mobile-friendly using Tailwind's utility-first approach.
4. Data Visualization: Recharts was used for easily customizable and responsive charts.

## Trade-offs & Assumptions
1. Assumed that uploaded CSV files are properly formatted and contain expected fields.
3. Live aggregation is used for insights. For large data sets, optimizations may be needed.
4. A constant maximum warehouse volume of 60,000,000,000 cmÂ³ is used for utilization.
5. The app is public and unauthenticated to focus on core functionality for the coding challenge.
6. Daily carrier shipment bar chart may be cluttered for long time periods, so added a dropdown to filter by time range.
